# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?


DriverPass is a small organization that needs a website to help students prepare for the examination and on-the-road training.  The client also wants to tap into this program from multiple devices so that work on this site can be done remotely.  The idea is to improve scheduling and reservations and have a traceable edit to follow who is making the edits when issues arise.



What did you do particularly well?


I stuck to my strengths which are designing of the system.  Breaking down the steps so the client could easily understand the layout.  This is an important part of the project and would be critical to sell the progess to its potential customers.



If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?


While is may not have been reflected in my work I struggled with the non-functional and functional relationships.  Grasping how they will fluctuate as the project evolvesI had to really concentrate that I would communicate those points which took longer than I had projected.  I think showing others a rough draft to show the direction you are wanting to take would be helpful so you don't waste time especially on quick turn projects.



How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?


This was an easy task having moved to thw United States after I married my husband overseas I had to take the written and driver's test which I had not completed in over 10 years.  So knowing the process I felt like I understood what the client would need.  What I would have wanted had this company been available to me when I was getting ready for me first exam.  Understanding what the client and students need is what drives this project so getting feedback early and often makes adjustments easier and gives them a sense that you are including them along the whole journey.



How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?


I laid out the process map and placed tasks that needed to be added so I knew where to start to branch off the new requirements while still wrapping them into the program.  What I would do int he future is create a "Sandbox" that I would have the client tests have him provide me someone that could test the environment and have someone take notes or suggestions realtime.  Many times people act or respond to somthing differently than if they have to fill out a survey.
